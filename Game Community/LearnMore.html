          <h2>Welcome To T1Gaming - Black Desert Online</h2>
          <p>Thank you for your interest in our guild. Please read all of the rules displayed, as it is what has made us very successful in Dragon Nest. This is not a guild for bandits or trolls so please look elsewhere as we do not tolerate it for long. If you are interested in a guild filled with dedicated individuals then this may be a place for you whether noob or pro. We accept all international players as long as you are able to understand english in written/spoken form. At the moment our doors are open to individuals that would like to learn and play along with us in a mature environment. Once North America servers come online, do expect the entire guild to shift our attention to it. Also know that my stream personality and guild personality is different. I may be silly and swear a lot on streams, but I am a very serious and unforgiving guild leader that cares very much about what my guild and I have built together these past 4 years. I look forward to knowing every single person's name and background. Every guild has a group that makes up the core members. We are looking for those special persons that can benefit our family. If you would like to learn more about us, check out our youtube. Many of the same guildies you see in the videos will be or is already playing Black Desert in preparation for North America release. <b>-T</b>

                  Many people get the wrong idea when they hear T1 or T1Gaming. Some get the idea that it is a rip off name of other well known organizations like SKT1, TEGaming, and other groups. The fact is it has a completely different meaning. T1 is the phonetic spelling of the Hmong words &#147;tib ib&#148; which is pronounced &#147;tee eee&#148; . In literal terms &#147;tee&#148; means &#147;place&#148; and &#147;eee&#148; means &#147;one&#148; . Put it together and it has the meaning of &#147;first place&#148; or &#147;number one&#148; . T1 in essence is a train of thought of continuous improvement. You will always hear me say on stream &#147;Don&#145;t Suck&#148; . It means to try your best even if the odds are against you, don&#145;t be a sheep, and don&#145;t be a coward.

              <br> T1Gaming only accepts members that are of similar personalities, goals and values to its own. All of our members support and follow our core guild rules and anyone who cannot, will be removed. Our core rules and values have served us well since early 2012 and has continued to be the guiding principles behind the progress of the guild. Our core rules include, but are not limited to:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Guild first:</strong> We expect all members to ensure that all actions they take are done in the mindset of 'guild first'. Anything a member does reflects on the overall guild image and on all fellow members. We expect members to only take actions that reflect positively on the guild image that we have worked very hard to build and maintain over the years.</li>
              <li><strong>We recruit the person not the toon.</strong> We look for good people not only a toon that meets a specific set of requirements. As such, members of T1Gaming cannot be a member of any other competitive guild that has a branch of their guild in any game we play. This does not imply that you cannot associate with other guilds.</li>
              <li><strong>Do not be a ghost.</strong> In order to befriend one another, a part of your personal identity (age/gender/time zone/preferred alias/etc) will be needed. Be yourself when communicating with the guild. Refrain from becoming someone you are not to fit in with the guild (i.e using false identities). Please keep in mind, your account information will never be asked by any members of T1Gaming so do not give out that information to anyone.</li>
              <li><strong>Keep our secrets.</strong> It is not permitted to relay any information outside the guild, for any reason, at any time. T1Gaming is a private gaming organization. We do not share information with the public except through official channels and officially sanctioned outlets. Therefore no member should reveal any information, no matter how minor they may think it is, outside the guild.</li>
              <li><strong>Participate In Guild Events.</strong> Hunts, Events, and other in game activities occur all the time. You are expected to take place in as many of them as possible. We understand people have lives and cannot live within the online world and that is ok. But if you are online, and we are having a guild event of some sort, you need to be there and participating in it. Actively working against the guild on any mission will result in immediate and permanent removal.</li>
              <li><strong>Follow orders.</strong> Leadership roles in T1Gaming are decided based on demonstrated abilities as well as the need for a leader in a particular spot. You can be assured that your leaders are working hard to make the game more fun for you. While the reason behind every decision may not always be apparent at the moment an order is issued, all orders from officers need to be followed immediately.</li>
              <li><strong>We are a team.</strong> Backing up your guildmates is expected because they will do the same for you. T1Gaming members understand that sometimes personal character sacrifice is needed for the team to complete a mission. We don’t view it as personal sacrifice, however, because we are helping out a friend and that is more important than loot or pixels on a screen. Games come and go, T1Gaming and the friendships within it, remains.</li>
              <li><strong>Communicate through Discord.</strong> All members must have a Discord account and are expected to be actively using it during raids/events/sieges. For those that like alone time, although It is not a required daily use, speaking on a mic helps put a voice/face to a character in game and is highly recommended to interact and get to know guild members. Discord etiquette is expected with every member. Link to Discord etiquette.</li>
              <li><strong>Do not leech and beg for power leveling.</strong> We are here to help each other progress through the game and are not here to spoon feed anyone. All of that is earned. If you constantly spam guild chat with requests for power leveling or begging for carry, you will be removed instantly.</li>
              <li><strong>Deadweight is not needed.</strong> Failure to maintain an acceptable level of activity will result in your removal. Any member who is offline for 14+ days may be removed from the guild. We do have an "inactive" status for members who are retired from games we play and wish to join us in future games. For those active in games, we expect them to read our raidcall/discord announcement for updates. Simply vanishing off the face of the earth without any email indicating you wish to go to inactive status is taken as a sign you have quit the guild and membership is removed. Do not leave inactive alts in guild, we are online everyday and will notice those who park characters in guild.</li>
              <li><strong>Do not try to be someone you are not.</strong> Eg. Fake personality, identity, spies. It is better to be honest than letting us find out. We always find out.</li>
              <li><strong>Members who cannot follow core rules and standards, will be removed.</strong></li>

          <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="standards">
            <p>
              <strong>These standards go hand in hand with our core guild rules but they bear repeating so all future members understand what we expect from members. Those standards of conduct include, but are not limited to:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Members may not use cheats or exploits.</li>
              <li>Partaking in consensual pvp is a fun and profitable aspects of the game. However, members must be professional and refrain from causing dismay regardless of the outcome.</li>
              <li>Upholding of all guild values and rules is required from all members. There are no exceptions whether you are a member for 10 days or 10 years. All members must maintain the values of the guild.</li>
              <li>Members need to behave in a mature, professional, team focused manner. Self focused, loot focused, immature people will not be tolerated.</li>
              <li>Make friends in the guild. At our core we are a Team Of Friends, so make friends. Those friendships make us strong.</li>
              <li>Any issues with guild policies are brought up directly to T, 1 on 1, through raidcall/discord. Publicly bashing or complaining about them will not be tolerated.</li>
              <li>Personal attacks on other members is not permitted. Handle issues with another player 1 on 1, in a mature professional way. Seek an officer’s help if needed, but do not personally attack other members.</li>
              <li>Backstabbing, looting, stealing from, scamming or otherwise harming other members is not permitted.</li>
              <li>Excessive profanity, sexual, and obscene content are not permitted in public guild channels, Raidcall/Discord or Guild chat.</li>
              <li>In trying to assist resolving potential problems that may arise amongst members in our guild, if a guild officer tells you to do something, do it immediately. Do not argue or complain to them and definitely do not get nasty with them or removal will occur and you can explain to T why you had to behave that way and should be let back in.</li>
